## Idea:
This web application is specifically designed to assist store managers in efficiently managing multiple warehouses located in different cities and locations. In addition to providing a streamlined solution for organizing products within these warehouses and tracking their movement, it also includes a feature for building teams composed of various workers and managers. By enabling collaboration among team members, the application enhances operational efficiency and optimizes inventory management processes. Moreover, it helps maintain accurate records of product movement within the company's warehousing infrastructure.

call myEnv/Scripts/activate
```
3. **Install Flask and dependencies**:
Make sure your virtual environment is activated and in your cmd write down:
```sh
pip install Flask
```
4. **Navigate to the project directory** containing the Flask app's entry point file (`server.py`):
```sh
cd path/to/entry/UltimateInventory
```
5. **Start the server**:
```sh
python server.py
```
6. Open your web browser and visit the specified URL or endpoint to access the web app.(Usually, it's localhost:5000):
